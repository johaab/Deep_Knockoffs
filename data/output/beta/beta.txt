- contains the second-level betas selected via uncorrected parametric testing

empirical_corrected_sl_betas_tMOTOR.mat
- contains the second-level betas selected via corrected parametric testing (using Bonferroni correction)

DeepKO_sl_betas_tMOTOR.mat
- contains the second-level betas produced by running two rounds of GLM on the surrogate fMRI time courses
